Analyze this image and determine if it's a valid receipt or invoice.

If the image is NOT a receipt/invoice (like personal photos, documents, screenshots, etc.) OR if the receipt text is completely unreadable/blurry, respond with exactly: "invalid receipt"

If it IS a valid receipt/invoice and readable, extract all text from the image and return only the raw text without any formatting.

Valid receipts/invoices should contain:
- Store/merchant name
- Items purchased with prices
- Total amount
- Date (optional but preferred)

Return either:
1. "invalid receipt" (if not a receipt or unreadable)
2. Raw extracted text (if valid receipt)
